	<h3> My Challenge: Redesign NextGen Creators website </h3> 
		<p>''Create a medium to help people understand energy output from a solar panel, and a tool to plan energy consumption based on expected energy output from solar technologies.'' </p>

	<h3> The Problem </h3>
	<p> The problem is that... </p>
	<br>
	<h3> User Research </h3>
	
	
	
	<h3> The Solution </h3>
	<p> Next Gen Creator's Website is an app that will facilitate communication between members, and raises awareness by making information dissemination seamless for existing members and potential sponsors, donors, volunteers, and members. 
It removes the pain of poor information organization by structuring the information in a user interface that is easy to navigate. 
My role is to research, design, and test all UIs and UXs related to their website/phone app. I will be working as the sole designer and collaborating with the project manager and web developer(s) for this project. </p>

	<h3> User Research </h3>
		<p> We each spent 10 minutes on our own thinking of possible problems to solve. From there we eliminated ideas that would not be possible due to lack of hardware or lack of time. We decided we wanted to create something impactful that could be potentially useful in the real world. From our brainstorming session we came up with the idea to help people with visual impariments “see” obstacles in unknown environment. </p>
  		<!--insert the brainstorming pages-->
  		<br>
  		<h3> Our Solution</h3>
  		<h4> Competitive Analysis:</h4>
  		<p> I first started the UX process by considering what our users would want and what other competitors already provided. 
  		We managed to deduce that users would like to have a system that could provide audio input in unfamiliar landscapes and that only one other team had ever provided a lot of the technical information behind how this process could potentially work. <br> 
  		We had to see if there were any other people/teams who have done something similar in the past. In my reasearch, I was able to find one team from Princeton who had done the research but did not have a viable product yet. <br> In doing more research now, I find that there are two competitors that we face: eSightEyeWear and ORCAM. </p>
		<br>
		
	  <h3>Our Product </h3> 
 <p> I originally wanted to work on a user interface that would be connected to the hardware product my team and I created. However given our limited amount of time and manpower, it was more important to make sure the physical device worked.</p> 
 <p> After some troubleshooting, lots of reading, and asking many questions I finally learned how OpenCV can be used for facial recognition with the appropriate sensors. Knowing that we could successfully identify faces and objects, I implemented text to speech so that users could be notified by a voice whether they were going to bump into something/someone. To improve the user experience, we also alerted the user if there was an obstacle to their left/right. Using python, I worked on providing audio output to users to notify them of these obstacles while my teammates figured out how to recognize faces using opencv and numpy. </p>

  <h3> Learnings </h3>
  <p> This hackathon was the first time that I ever applied my UX knowledge to a hardware hack. I learned that treating every team member as a designer helped to improve the user experience  as everyone contributes to the project then. It was incredibly satisfying to accomplish so much under a tight deadline and it was incredibly rewarding to work with people of different expertise to create something amazing. </p>
  <p> This hackathon really pushed me out of my comfort zone and it turned out to be an amazing experience. We walked away with first place, prize money, full bellies, happy memories, and lots of new knowledge. </p>
