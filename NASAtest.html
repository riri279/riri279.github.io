	<h3> Our Challenge: You Are My Sunshine (YAMS) </h3> 
		<p>''Create a medium to help people understand energy output from a solar panel, and a tool to plan energy consumption based on expected energy output from solar technologies.''
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Day 1: Research + wireframes </h3>
	<h4> Problem: </h4>
		<p> People don't understand how solar energy works, how much energy comes from solar panels, and how to use it efficiently because other websites are hard to understand or difficult to navigate.</p>
  		<p> After a little bit of brainstorming,		<!--insert the brainstorming pages-->
		 we divided up the work so that we could be most effective with our time, talents, and resources.</p>

 		<p> As someone with little knowledge about solar energy I needed to identify what users would want to know and find a unique and easy way to deliver this information. </p>
  		
  		<h4> Research Target Audience:</h4>
  		<p> Our target audience are people who do not currently have solar panels and/or do not understand how solar power can help them. </p>
  		<p> Our users want to learn how solar energy works, to learn from historical data, and use solar energu efficiently. For instance, accessing a graph that shows their energy usage. Users then have a way to schedule their electricity usage according to solar energy production (do laundry at X time, do dishes at Y time). Keep in mind, with the increase in automation it's likely that appliances could be scheduled to operate at certain times. Futhermore, solar energy production data would be provided in real time and users would be able to have a profile on the website (to save data and reduce inputs needed from the user). </p>
      	<p> In knowing the needs of our users, I conducted a competitive analysis.</p>
       	<!-- Trigger the Modal -->	
<div class="w3-row-padding">
  <div class="w3-container w3-third">
    <img src="competitive analysis NASA.png" style="width:100%;cursor:pointer" 
    onclick="onClick(this)" class="w3-hover-opacity">
  </div>
			<!-- The Modal -->
			<div id="myModal" class="modal">

			  <!-- The Close Button -->
			  <span class="close" onclick="document.getElementById('myModal').style.display='none'">&times;</span>

			  <!-- Modal Caption (Image Text) -->
			  <div id="Competitive analysis of existing applications and websites that provided resources and information about solar panels."></div>
			</div>
    		
   		  <script> 
// Get the modal
(function () {
   'use strict';
   // this function is strict...

var modal = document.getElementById('myModal');

// Get the image and insert it inside the modal - use its "alt" text as a caption
var img = document.getElementById('myImg');
var modalImg = document.getElementById("img01");
img.onclick = function(){
    modal.style.display = "block";
    modalImg.src = this.src;
    captionText.innerHTML = this.alt;
};

// Get the <span> element that closes the modal
var span = document.getElementsByClassName("close")[0];

// When the user clicks on <span> (x), close the modal
span.onclick = function() { 
  modal.style.display = "none";
};// JavaScript Document
}());
</script>

	<h3> Our Product</h3>
	<p> Our platform would tell them how much they can save from having solar energy, comparing how much energy they currently consume, and how much money they could save in using solar panels. It also provides easy to understand information about solar energy and how it works. Furthermore, we listed the three main types of solar panels that users can buy and companies that offer them. </p>
	<p> YAMS would also tell them when they should use solar energy and how to save by using solar energy efficiently (ie. during peak hours of solar energy production or when the sun is out). </p>
	<p> The user would also benefit from learning based on historical data, accessing a graph that shows their energy usage that way they can schedule their electricity usage according to solar energy production (do laundry at X time, do dishes at Y time). Solar energy production data would be provided in real time and users would be able to have a profile on the website (to save data and reduce inputs needed from the user improving usability of the product).</p>

	  <h3>Day 2: Wireframes, visual design, coding </h3> 
	  <p> Let the wire framing begin! </p>
 <p> First, I created several wire frames (see below for one of them) which were then pass to the developers (ie. can this be coded?) and so that they can begin to code. Then repeat this process until the wireframes are completed. My fellow designer (David Hai) was working on the Style Guide and creaing icons in the meantime. Finally we integrated the UI created by my fellow designer with the wireframes that had been coded by the developers. 
 </p> 
 <p> Bits and pieces of the design came together and were passed onto the developers as they were completed to speed up the process.</p>
<!-- insert wireframes here-->
	<p> It was a LONG day but so much fun!</p>
	<br>
  <h3> Day 3: Visual design + developers coding </h3>
  
  <p> There was so much last minute work to be completed. There were last minute technical difficulties that we encountered. There were errors in the coding. Some of the wireframes came together a bit later than expected. Yet, everything somehow came together at the end and @2PM judging began and somehow.... we won! Thanks to .space for providing domains for everyone at the hackathon and providing DRONES to the team with the best website design and user experience (ie. us)!

	<h3> Takeaways: Difficulties and learnings </h3>
	 <h4> What I found most difficult: </h4>
<p> It was difficult to get a grasp of the concept and then translate the concept into the user experience and user interface design. However, with little sleep and lots of questions, we pushed through and were able to deliver an amazing product. </p>
	  <h4> What I learned:</h4>
<p> I really enjoyed using the Agile design process for this hackathon and I'm definitely going to use it again in future hackathons! It is very satisfying to bring people of different educational/knowledge backgrounds (environment experts, developers, designers, etc.) together to create a useful product.
